Proposal: Explore satellite imagery for the classification of landcover classes

Datasets and description: https://csc.lsu.edu/~saikat/deepsat/

The labelled datasets consist of 28x28x4 images, with each image classified into landcover classes. Images were extracted from larger satellite image tiles (~6000 x ~7000 pixels), and selected to represent balanced and non-overlapping training sets.

Successful development of an effective landcover classifier from this training set could then be further developed for direct use on comparable satellite imagery.
